Stochastic Grid-Model consists of cells which can be either start, end or obstacle(X).
The above figure displays an instance of the Grid with 3 rows and 4 columns. The agent
starts the episode at the start cell and terminates at one of the end cells. At each step,
the agent can choose one of the 4 actions corresponding to 4 directions (Up, Down, Left Right)
For example, if the agent chooses an Up action it moves to the cell upwards with probability 0.8
if the cell upwards is not obstacle and inside the grid. The agent moves to left and right cells
with probability 0.1 each if those cells are available. (not obstacle and inside).
The reward is 0 for transitions to the all cells except the end-cells. The reward of the transition
to the end cell is specified by the grid  as displayed above.
