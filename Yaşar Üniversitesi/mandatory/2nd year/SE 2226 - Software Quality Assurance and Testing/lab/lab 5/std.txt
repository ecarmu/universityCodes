Lab work;

Write a basic ATM program where the customer can perform the given operations on below.
- Deposit Money
- Withdraw Money
- Money Transfer (to another customer)
- Display Account Info
- Change Password

For every operation, a message must be displayed to the user to inform him/her.
A list of example messages :
-Your new balance is 3500 ₺
-You send 500 ₺ to the Ayşe with customer id 1234
-You deposit 100₺
-Your password successfully changed

Password Rules :
-It must be a 4-digit number
-It can not be a year between 1900-2000
-All digits can not be the same such as 0000 , 1111 , 9999 etc.
-It should not contain repeating 2-digit numbers such as 3535 , 6363 , 9595 etc.
-It should be different from the last 3 password.

You will try to find exploits and possible bugs in the code and, write unit tests by using the concepts that you learnt.
ATM package is written by me that contains both problems and some design issues commented briefly in Rule Interface and ATM class.
You may try to improve/change them to perform the operations more efficiently.
