To make sure code successfully connects to the database, these are the things should be there:


- "mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar" file must exist at the inside of the "final_project" folder

- At under the external libraries section, "mysql-connector-j-8.0.33.jar" file should be seen



-> Final note: I am not sure whether this is like that or not but... if code still does not connects to the database even though 
described things at the top are done, then it might be related to ".jar file"s version
Maybe your mysql version might be different and that might be the cause of the problem

So, using different .jar file might help
