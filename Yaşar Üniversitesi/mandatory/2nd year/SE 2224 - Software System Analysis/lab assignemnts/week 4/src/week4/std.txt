    Airline Ticket System 
(Boeing 737 MAX series airplanes crushed due to software problems,further productions are canceled,customer sue for damages, estimated cost = 500.000.000.000$
(NASA lost spacecraft due to conversion mistakes in metric systems , estimated cost = 125.000.000$)
(Student did not study for SE1106 , failed in lesson with continuing versions and retake all of them , estimated cost = ~36.000 TL )



Flight and Ticket type classes only have basic implementations like toString method, getter&setter with minor changes
The main flow of the code controlled with 'Controller' classes that has four main job to do, which declared as function in BaseController



Destination and Departure Cities will be read from "cities.txt" File.!!!



Ticket has;
    constructor takes Flight flight, ArrayList<Integer> info

for both Ticket and Flight write toString method and implement necessary getter&setters (do not put every getter&setter, just use necessaries)






Test your code to see if it works correctly with a GUI
* Main Frame
* Create Flight Frame
* Buy Ticket Frame
* List Frame both tickets and flights
